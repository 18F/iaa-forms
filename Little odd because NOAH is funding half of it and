Little odd because NOAH is funding half of it and I"m funding half.

One thing not in the project  was the SoW, which I've just dropped in. Renaming it so it's in the right order.

Adding a new field to the form prep survey adds it to the end (last column) of the response sheet, regardless of where he places it.

I cut and paste into both the 7600 A and B.

- I didn't standardize the address form. I have to standardize that. I didn't want to annoy people with that. In realtime we could validate that.

-This is a random IAA number...

-Can't uncheck "Other renewal" on form A

- Line 7 on A is up to Josh

- Would like to generate a tracking number to track them internally.


Line 12 is boilerplate language. It'd be great if this were a smart default.

Line 19 should say "Please Form 7600A, Attachment 1" That will always say that. Same thing goes for Box 20.
