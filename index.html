        <h1 class="page-title">Let&rsquo;s work together!</h1>
        <p class="synopsis">We&rsquo;re delighted to hear you&rsquo;re interested in working with us. Here&rsquo;s an overview of the process we&rsquo;ll need to go through before we begin:</p>
        <ol class="table-of-contents">
          <li>Decide you want to work with us (yay!)</li>
          <li>Do paperwork (our lawyers make us do this)</li>
          <li>Make cool stuff</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>What do you mean paperwork?</h1>
        <p>We&rsquo;re helping to reshape government as fast as we can, but that doesn&rsquo;t get us out of having to work the way it&rsquo;s used to working. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll happen after we decide to work together.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Receive and approve a statement of work from your 18F project lead.</li>
          <li>Read our <a href="primer.html">Primer on Interagency Agreements</a>.</li>
          <li>Complete our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1yuZ5ITewyEo1CPqxmoKLGj_BhX9GTDI6UF2sQSQbvBk/viewform"><abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr> Form Preparation Survey.</a></li>
          <li>
            Take receipt of an <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>.
